Hangman

Hangman is a game which runs on Javascript.

Hangman is a word guessing game. This started out as a paper-and-pencil game that can involve two or more players. One player will think of a word, phrase or sentence and the other player(s) will try to guess the word within a certain number of guesses. Each incorrect guess will cause an element of hangman being drawn. If the players guess the word before the drawing is complete they win, otherwise they lose to the player who set the word.

In this game the user plays against the computer which will generate a random word to be guessed. Instructions are provided in the game to teach the user how to play.
